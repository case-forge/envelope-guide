/**
 * BundleTool Node module-resolver hook.
 *
 * Modules shared by every page live in the site's static/vendor/ and the browser
 * sources import them as root-absolute '/vendor/x.js'. Node has no site root, so
 * this hook maps those specifiers onto the files (and '/js/shared/x.js', the
 * site's shared scripts such as the EXIF orientation module, onto
 * static/js/shared/). Nothing is copied and nothing is rewritten:
 * any Node consumer (the tests, the command line tool) imports public/js/*.js
 * directly, byte for byte as it ships, and so gets exactly one instance of the
 * PDF library.
 * Two instances of one library make every `instanceof` across the boundary
 * false, which shows up as an outline that reads back empty and destination
 * arrays that serialise as dictionaries.
 *
 * Loaded via scripts/node-compat.mjs: do not `--import` this file directly.
